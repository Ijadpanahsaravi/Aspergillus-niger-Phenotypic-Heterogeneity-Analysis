# Aspergillus-niger-Phenotypic-Heterogeneity-Analysis

This repository contains the analysis code and visualizations for time-lapse imaging data of *Aspergillus niger* strains.  
The aim is to quantify and visualize **phenotypic heterogeneity** in **spore area** and **contrast** across different strains at the initial time point (`time = 0`).
